# Pong Game - Python Implementation

**Project by Aurelian-Octavian Găină**  
*Simplified Pong Game developed using Python*

## 🎮 Overview

This project is a simplified version of the classic Pong game, developed in Python. It utilizes the `turtle` library for creating graphical elements such as paddles, the ball, and the scoreboard. Additionally, the `winsound` library is used to incorporate sound effects for ball bounces, enhancing the gaming experience.

## 🚀 Features

- **Two-Player Mode:** Play locally with friends on the same computer.
- **Simple Controls:** Keyboard bindings for paddle movements.
- **Sound Effects:** Realistic bounce sounds using `winsound`.
- **Dynamic Gameplay:** Real-time ball speed and direction changes.
- **Score Tracking:** Automatically updates scores when goals are made.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Turtle Library:** For graphical interface and game rendering.
- **Winsound Library:** For adding sound effects.
