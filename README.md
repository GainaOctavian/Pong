# Pong-Python-
In this project I made a simplified pong game by mostly making use of the turtle library for the shapes of the paddles (paleta), the ball (minge) and the pen (pix).
Aditionally, I utilising the winsound library in order to incorporate a sound for the bouncing of the ball. After defining all the elements I'm using, I established functions 
for every movement of the paddles (paleta_a, paleta_b). After this I made some keybindings for both of the players, as the game is supposed to be played on the same 
computer. After all this, I created the main while loop, that updates the screen after every iteration. In this loop I made a few if statements that verify if the ball(minge) has 
reached one of the margins and, if so, modifying the player score and resetting the game. After this, I formed some if statements that verify the ball (minge) and 
paddle (paleta) collisions, and if confirmed, triggering the ball bouncing sound and redirecting the ball's course.
